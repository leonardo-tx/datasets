Bring Me The Horizon,a bulleT w/ my namE On,"I guess this is goodbye
I guess we got what we deserved
Hold on to your heart, it's almost over
I guess I should've known
I guess a part of me still ho-oped
Broken from the start (the beat in my chest sounds like a swan song)
You got a bullet with my name on
(You got a bullet with my name on)

A moment of silence
For a lifetime laid to waste
Now you're underground
Still sounds like violence
Still got both feet in the grave
You can't drown it out

I'm dreaming backwards
Nobody answers
I won't look down again

I guess this is goodbye
I guess we got what we deserve
Hold on to your heart
It's almost over (my soul's collateral to you)
I guess I should've known
I guess a part of me still hoped
Broken from the start (the beat in my chest sounds like a swan song)
You got a bullet with my name on

I'm sorry
Did my back hurt your knife?
Let me kiss it better
This time I promise that I'll die
Do the waltz with your alibi
If Jesus Christ returns
Well just kill that fucker twice

We get so lost (we get so lost)
Inside of your eyes
We get so lost (we get so lost)
Still feel the butterflies
But they're gone

I guess this is goodbye
I guess we got what we deserve
Hold on to your heart
It's almost over (my soul's collateral to you)
I guess I should've known
I guess a part of me still hoped
Broken from the start (the beat in my chest sounds like a swan song)
You got a bullet with my

Name on
Your lullabies keep me awake
I picked up your tab (paid in blood)
Saw things you never (never should)
My bloody valentine of dirt

I'm dreaming backwards
Nobody answers
I won't look down again

I guess this is goodbye
I guess we got what we deserve (we got what we deserve)
Hold on to your heart, it's almost over (my soul's collateral to you)
I guess I should've known (I guess I should've known)
I guess a part of me still hoped (a part of me still hoped)
Broken from the start (the beat in my chest sounds like a swan song)
You got a bullet with my name on

You got a bullet with my name on
You got a bullet with my name on

Linkin Park,Heavy is the Crown,"It's pourin' in, you're laid on the floor again
One knock at the door and then
We both know how the story ends
You can't win if your white flag's out when the war begins
Aimin' so high, but swingin' so low
Tryin' to catch fire, but feelin' so cold
Hold it inside and hope it won't show
I'm sayin' it's not, but inside I know

Today's gonna be the day you notice
'Cause I'm tired of explainin' what the joke is

This is what you asked for, heavy is the crown
Fire in the sunrise, ashes rainin' down
Try to hold it in, but it keeps bleedin' out
This is what you asked for, heavy is the
Heavy is the crown

Turn to run, now look what it's become
Outnumbered, ten to one
Back then, should've bit your tongue
'Cause there's no turnin' back this path once it's begun
You're already on that list
Say you don't want what you can't resist
Wavin' that sword when the pen won't miss
Watch it all fallin' apart like this

This is what you asked for, heavy is the crown
Fire in the sunrise, ashes rainin' down
Try to hold it in, but it keeps bleedin' out
This is what you asked for, heavy is the

Sleep Token,Take me back to Eden,"I dream in phosphorescence
Bleed through spaces
See you drifting past the fog, but no one told you where to go

We dive through crystal waters, perfect oceans
But no one told me not to breathe
And now the weightlessness recedes

My, my those eyes like fire
I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre
Come now, bite through these wires
I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired
Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher
Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire

I will travel far beyond the path of reason
Take me back to Eden
Take me back to Eden
Take me back to Eden

Well, yeah, I spit blood when I wake up
Sink porcelain stained, choking up brain matter and make-up
Just two days since the mainframe went down, and I'm still messed up
Room feels like a meat freezer
I dangle in like cold cuts
Missed calls, answer phones from people I just don't trust
Mirror talk, fake love
But I'll take a pound of your flesh 'fore you take a piece of my pay stub
White roses, black doves, godmother, rise up
I need you to see me for what I have become

My, my those eyes like fire
I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre
Come now, bite through these wires
I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired
Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher
Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire

I guess it goes to show, does it not?
That we've no idea what we've got
Until we lose it (until we lose it, until we lose it)
And no amount of love will keep it around
If we don't choose it (choose it)

And I don't know what's got its teeth in me
But I'm about to bite back in anger
No amount of self-sought fury
Will bring back the glory of innocence

My, my those eyes like fire
I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre
Come now, bite through these wires
I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired
Reset my patient violence along both lines of a path way higher
Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire

(When we were made, I know It was no accident)
(You know my desire)
(Tangled up like branches in a flood)

I have traveled far beyond the path of reason
Take me back to Eden
Take me back to Eden

EPIC,Love in Paradise,"[Athena]
Old friend
It's been ten years since I last saw you

[Odysseus]
Remember me!
I am the infamous Odysseus!
Oh, woah, woah

[Athena]
Let's see where you've been

[Aeolus]
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer

[Poseidon]
Ruthlessness is mercy upon oursel-

[Circe]
One wrong move and you're done for
Anything I-

[Tiresias]
Song of past romance, I see the

[Soldiers]
We won't take more suffering from you

[Scylla]
Drown in your sorrow and fears

[Eurylochus]
Captain?

[Odysseus]
I have to see her

[Eurylochus]
But we'll die

[Odysseus]
I know

[Athena]
Odysseus, where did you go?

[Calypso]
Morning, sleepyhead
You've been resting for a while
I swore that you were dead
When you washed up on my isle
Did you know you talk in your sleep?
Tell me, though, who's Penelope?

[Odysseus]
She's my wife

[Calypso]
Anyways, I've got all you could want here
All you could need here
Just you and me, my dear, my love for life
Soon, into bed we'll climb and spend our time

[Odysseus]
I'm not your man

[Calypso]
I'm what you want here
I'm what you need here
Just you and me, my love in paradise
Now till the end of time
From here on out, you're mine, all mine

[Odysseus]
Hell no, I could kill you where you stand
I'm no pet, I'm a married man

[Calypso]
Oh handsome, you may try
But last I checked, goddesses can't die

[Odysseus]
Goddess?

[Calypso]
You're adorable
Bow down now to the immortal Calypso, here to entertain
But fear not, I bring no pain
Cause we've got
All we could want here
All we could need here
Under my spell, we're stuck in paradise
No one can come nor go, my island stays unknown

[Odysseus]
No, no
I don't belong here
There's something wrong here
I won't be drawn to love in paradise
Not till the end of time, there is no way

[Calypso]
You're mine, all mine

[Athena]
Seven years, she's kept you trapped, out of your control
Time can take a heavy toll

[Calypso]
Odysseus?

[Odysseus]
All I hear are screams

[Calypso]
Ody, get away from the ledge

[Odysseus]
You don't know what I've gone through
You don't know what I've sacrificed
Every comrade I long knew
Every friend, I saw them die
And all I hear are screams

[Calypso]
It will be fine, dear
Come back inside, dear
Love of my life, come back to paradise

[Odysseus]
Let me close my eyes

[Calypso]
I know your life's been hard
I'll stay inside your heart

[Odysseus]
All I hear are screams

[Calypso, Odysseus]
I love you, my dear
I love our time here
Life would be so much worse
(Just let me close my eyes)
If you had died
Please stay away from harm
Stay in my open arms
(All I hear are)

[Polites, Eurylochus, Anticlea, Odysseus]
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
How much longer till your luck runs out?
Waiting, waiting, waiting
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
How much longer till the show goes south?
Oh
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start
How much longer till we all fall down?
Oh
Waiting, waiting, waiting
Greet the world with open arms, greet the world with open arms

[Odysseus]
Athena!

[Athena]
He needs my help

Sleeping With Sirens,Scene Two - Roget Rabbit,"Is there a right way for how this goes?
You got your friends
And you got your foes
They want a piece of something hot
Forget your name like they forgot

Ain’t that something?

Some wanna see you crash and burn
And criticize your every word
I’m tryna keep from goin’ insane
Ain’t that the way of this whole damn thing?

Trying to be something more

Nobody’s gonna love you if
You can’t display a way to capture this
Nobody’s gonna hold your hand
And guide you through
No, it’s up for you to understand

Nobody’s gonna feel your pain
When all is done
And it’s time for you to walk away
So when you have today
You should say all that you have to say
Say all that you have to say

Is there a right way for being strong?
Feels like I’m doing things all wrong
Still, I’m here just holdin’ on
Confess my heart
And forgive my wrongs

Just tryna show you something more

Nobody’s gonna love you if
You can’t display a way to capture this
Nobody’s gonna hold your hand
And guide you through
It’s up for you to understand

Nobody’s gonna feel your pain
When all is done
And it’s time for you to walk away
When you have today
You should say all that you have to say

Don’t point the blame
When you can’t find nothing
Look to yourself
And you might find something

It’s time that we sorted out
All of the things we complain about
So listen close to the sound of your soul
Take back a life we lived once before

If it ain’t you, then who?
If it ain’t you, then who is gonna love you?

Nobody’s gonna love you if
You can’t display a way to capture this
Nobody’s gonna hold your hand
And guide you through
It’s up for you to understand

Nobody’s gonna feel your pain
When all is done
And it’s time for you to walk away
When you have today
You should say all that you have to say

So when you have today
Say all that you have to say

SLAVES,True Colors,"I always felt uneasy when we weren't in the same place
Taken back by the feeling that this could all go away
She said: Baby I would never do what those girls do
Funny, I’d only hear that when it benefitted you

Did I get too close?
Didn’t mean to have your true colors exposed

Wait, did you ever take a moment just to think about anyone
Anyone other than yourself?
Give me back the love I wasted now
Cold, one day it's gonna hit you: You’re alone
I won’t be there, won't be there
It's cruel to turn around
Give me back the love I wasted now

It’s your eyes that told me you were in it
All the flags that were red, I told myself they were tinted
Then I noticed that you couldn’t stand the sight of your own shadow
Like the devil on your shoulder, couldn’t stand to wait much longer

Did I get too close?
Didn’t mean to have your true colors exposed
Imperfections start to show, that’s when I wanted you more

Wait, did you ever take a moment just to think about anyone
Anyone other than yourself?
Give me back the love I wasted now
Cold, one day it's gonna hit you: You’re alone
I won’t be there, won't be there
It's cruel to turn around
Give me back the love I wasted now

Give me back the love I wasted now
Now, now!

Wait, did you ever take a moment just to think about anyone
Anyone other than yourself?
Give me back the love I wasted now
Cold, one day it's gonna hit you: You’re alone
I won’t be there, won't be there
It's cruel to turn around
Give me back the love I wasted now!
Now, now!

One Night Only,Never Be The Same,"You see colors fly around your head
And you don't know why, you don't know why
You called out his name, and what's left unsaid
And you don't know why, you don't know why

And with all these clouds high above you
I guess it's gonna rain
And there's no one left to love you
It'll never be the same, it'll never be the same

Someone said his name and it broke your heart
And you don't know why, you don't know why
You look up at the sky while you neal and pray
And you wonder why, you don't know why

And with all these clouds high above you
I guess it's gonna rain
Now there's no one left to love you
It'll never be the same, it'll never be the same

All alone you count the days
And all you know just flies away
All in favour, scream it wide
Just plead your head to love or cry
And say goodbye

Someone said his name and it broke your heart
And you don't know why, you don't know why
You look up at the sky while you neal and pray
And you wonder why, you don't know why

And with all these clouds high above you
I guess it's gonna rain
Now there's no one left to love you
It'll never be the same, it'll never be the same [x4]

Porter Robinson,Everything Goes On,"Don't try to make yourself remember, darling
Don’t look for me, I'm just a story you've been told
So let’s pretend a little longer
'Cause when we're gone, everything goes on

Well, you were staring at the window
And I said: I wanna take you to the sea
And when 'm better, we'll do everything
I gotta stop makin' promises I can't keep

But if I was gone tomorrow, won't the waves crash on?
Is it selfish that I'm happy as we pass the setting Sun?
Someday I’ll bе overcast, but you won't have to cry
’Cause wе'll do the grieving, while I'm by your side
I said

Don't try to make yourself remember, darling
Don’t look for me; I'm just a story you've been told
So let's pretend a little longer
'Cause when we're gone, everything goes on

And I'm so scared of getting used to this
All the vines that keep you tethered in your room
Well, someday both of us are leaving here
But for now, I'll just bring the sea to you, oh

Will you meet me in the daylight like we did before?
Then I felt you on my shoulder and you weren't suffering anymore
You said: I'm sorry that you worried, but don't apologize
I told you to forget me, but you stayed by my side when I said

Don't try to make yourself remember, darling
Don't look for me, I'm just a story you've been told

Slipknot,Psychosocial,"Ooh, yeah

I did my time and I want out
So effusive, fade, it doesn't cut
The soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion
Pseudo-sacrosanct perversion

Go drill your deserts
Go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done, it has begun
I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

There are cracks in the road we laid
But where the temple fell
The secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new
But when we killed it all
The hate was all we had

Who needs another mess?
We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness
Venomous, insipid
I think we're done
I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

The limits of the dead
The limits of the dead
The limits of the dead
The limits of the dead

Fake anti-fascist lie (psychosocial)
I tried to tell you but (psychosocial)
Your purple hearts are giving out (psychosocial)
Can't stop the killing idea (psychosocial)
If it's hunting season (psychosocial)
Is this what you want? (Psychosocial)

Throw ourselves against the wall

'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?

It's funny how things work out
Such a bitter irony
Like a kick right to the teeth
It fell apart right from the start
But I couldn't even see
The forest for the trees

I'm afraid you asked for this

You made your bed when you worried about mine

Try and steal my flame just 'cause yours faded?
Well, hate is gasoline
A fire fueling all my dreams

Time won't help you, 'cause karma has no deadline

I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?

I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart, and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

Radiohead,How to Disappear Completely,"That there
That's not me
I go
Where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey

I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah, it's gone

And I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

Strobe lights
And blown speakers
Fireworks
And hurricanes

I'm not here

Shaman's Haverst,Ten Million Voices,"Are the whispers turning your mind
They're the wolves nipping at your heels
Trying to drag you down when the light is gone

And now winter is coming she preys on us all
Watch how they're mocking ready to fall
And our pulses are pounding to the sound of the drum

When it feels like your heart has been bled
And there's no more left to be said
Trying not to fall

There are ten million souls
Who are feeling like you
And ten million more who are finding the truth
Then it feels like you're right where you belong
When ten million voices are one

If you've finally had enough
Turn your fist to the sun
It's time to raise your voices and become one

And now winter is coming she preys on us all
Watch how they're mocking ready to fall
And our pulses are pounding to the sound of the drum

When it feels like your heart has been bled
And there's no more left to be said
Trying not to fall

There are ten million souls
Who are feeling like you
And ten million more who are finding the truth
Then it feels like you're right where you belong
When ten million voices are one

Lay down this crutch and bleed for us all
Will you have the stones to weather the storm
Open your eyes
Cuz you got to make up your mind

And it feels like your heart has been bled
And there's no more left to be said
Trying not to fall

When it feels like your heart has been bled
And there's no more left to be said
Trying not to fall

There are ten million souls
Who are feeling like you
And ten million more who are finding the truth
Then it feels like you're right where you belong
When ten million voices are one
When ten million voices are one

Eminem,Rap God,"Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it
(For six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen
But I don't know what

If that means what I think it means
We're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say
I'm not taking any chances
You were just what the doc ordered

I'm beginning to feel like a rap God, rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot

But, for me, to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match
With this rappity-rap
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack

And at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a mothafuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was under Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow?
All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time, period
Here's a maxipad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece

I'm beginning to feel like a rap God, rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret
To rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since
MC's get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students

Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac
N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and be in a position to meet Run DMC and induct them
Into the mothafuckin' Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church
And burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in
Is the alcohol of fame, on the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game
'Til I walk a flock of flames off a plank
And, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?

Little gay-looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy
You're witnessing a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say, looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label every day, looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say, looking boy
I get a hell, yeah from Dre, looking boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face, looking boy
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
To keep it up with the same pace, looking boy

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a rap God, rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately
With these bombs I'm toting
And I should not be woken, I'm the walking dead
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating

I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm
And pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal, but it's honestly futile
If I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while

So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch
I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case, 'cause even you unsigned rappers
Are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time
Where once I was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine

Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
Like that one line I said on I'm Back, from the Mathers LP
One when I tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine

See, if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was
But I'm morphing into an immortal, coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal

And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot you
Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singing to a man while they played piano

Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day: Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)

Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me
And it'll glue to you

And I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music

Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous
They confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop
'Cause I found a hella way to fuse it with rock
Shock rap with Doc

Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses
That versus you, it's curtains
I'm inadvertently hurting you
How many verses I gotta murder to

Prove that if you were half as nice your songs
You could sacrifice virgins too
School flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues

But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so Satan take the fucking wheel
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
Still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something
I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils
And here's what they want from me

They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life's handing you lemons
Make lemonade then, but if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan, it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip abroad
And make her fall on her face
And don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?

Bring Me The Horizon,Hospital For Souls,"(And then I found out how hard it is to really change)
(Even hell can get comfy once you've settled in)
(I just wanted the numb inside me to leave)
(No matter how fucked you get)
(Sorrow is there when you come back down)
(Funny thing is, all I ever wanted I already had)
(There's glimpses of heaven in every day)
(In the friends I have, the music I make, with the love I feel)
(I just had to start again)

The days are a deathwish
A witch hunt for an exit
I am powerless

The fragile, the broken
Sit in circles and stay unspoken
We are powerless

Because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
Silent halls and nameless faces
I am powerless

Everybody wants to go to Heaven, but nobody wants to die
I can't fear death, no longer, I've died a thousand times
Why explore the universe when we don't know ourselves?
There's an emptiness inside our heads that no one dares to dwell

Throw me to the flames
Watch me burn
Set my world ablaze
Watch me burn

How are we on a scale of one to ten?
Could you tell me what you see?
Do you wanna talk about it?
How does that make you feel?
Have you ever took a blade to your wrists?
Have you been skipping meals?
We're gonna try something new today
How does that make you feel?

Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
In this hospital for souls

Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
In this hospital for souls

Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
In this hospital for souls

Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
In this hospital for souls

Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
In this hospital for souls

Sleep Token,Mine,"I have waited
Paralysed by my own will
Viciously reminding me still
I'm born to believe
And I am certain, no
That you and I are crashing course
Driven by a holy force
I know you can see

That you will be mine
Yeah, you will be mine

We balance fire in the earth we walk
Will never stop me reaching forth
To see you again
With colours over all the wasted years
Eternity will bring you near
I know you can see
I know you can see

That you will be mine
Yeah, you will be mine

(Oh, you will bе mine)
You will be mine

Did you not say we were made for each other?
Did you not say we were made for each other?

I have waited
Paralysed by my own will
Viciously reminding me still
I'm born to believe
I am certain
That you and I are crashing course
Driven by a holy force
And oh, you can see

You will be mine
You will be mine

Pierce The Veil,King For A Day,"Dare me to jump off of this Jersey bridge
I bet you never had a Friday night like this
Keep it up, keep it up
Let's raise our hands
I take a lookup in the sky and I see red
Red for the cancer, red for the wealthy
Red for the drink that's mixed with suicide
Everything red

Please, won't you push me for the last time
Let's scream until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want this anymore
The thought of you is no fucking fun
You want a martyr, I'll be one
Because enough's enough
We're done

You told me: Think about it, well, I did
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor

The thing I think I love
Will surely bring me pain
Intoxication, paranoia, and a lot of fame
Three cheers for throwing up
Pubescent drama queen
You make me sick I make it worse by drinking late

(Scream) until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want to anymore
The thought of you is no fucking fun
You want a martyr I'll be one
Because enough's enough
We're done

You told me: Think about it, well, I did
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor

Imagine living like a king someday
A single night without a ghost in the walls
And if the bass shakes the earth underground
We'll start a new revolution now
(Alright here we go)

Hail Mary, forgive me
Blood for blood, hearts beating
Come at me, now this is war!

Fuck with this new beat
Oh

Now!

Terror begins inside a bloodless vein
I was just a product of the street youth rage
Born in this world without a voice or say
Caught in the spokes with an abandoned brain
I know you well but this ain't a game
Blow the smoke in a diamond shape
Dying is a gift so close your eyes and rest in peace

You told me: Think about it, well I did
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor

Imagine living like a king someday
A single night without a ghost in the walls
We are the shadows screaming: Take us now
We'd rather die than live to rust on the ground

Coolio,Gangsta's Paradise,"As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life
And realize there's nothing left
'Cause I've been brassing and laughing so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind has gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talking
And where ya walking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk

I really hate to trip, but I gotta LOC
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda g that little homie's wanna be like
On my knees in the night
Saying prayers in the streetlight

Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching got me chasing dreams
I'm an educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a LOC'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away
I'm living life do or die, what can I say?
I'm twenty-three now, will I live to see twenty-four?
The way things is going I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Minute after minute, hour after hour

It's going on in the kitchen
But I don't know what's cooking
They say I gotta learn
But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front

Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead!
Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Penelope
Penelope

[Penelope]
Don't you miss me?

[Odysseus]
More than you know

[Penelope]
Then jump in the water and kiss me

[Odysseus]
Penelope, I've told you this before
You know I'm afraid of the water

[Penelope]
I'll make sure that you are safe and sound
Come play with me and our daughter and let's watch our love leave the ground

[Odysseus]
Oh, I would
But I'd be suffering trying to float the whole time

[Penelope]
I would take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
Oh, as good as it sounds, right here I'm just finе

[Penelope]
I can take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
You know that I prеfer my feet on the ground

[Penelope]
I will take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
Fine, but only if you answer a question or two

[Penelope]
Of course!

[Odysseus]
Okay, so let's say I was on the run or hiding
From I don't know Poseidon
And let's say he blocked the way home with giant waves and giant storms

[Penelope]
Oh no!

[Odysseus]
How am I to evade him?
How am I to get home?
Which route should I take?
Where am I supposed to go?

[Penelope]
He will chase you high and low
So find a place he'd never go
The one way you'll get home
Is sailing where he's scared to roam, oh
It's through the lair of Scylla

[Odysseus]
No

[Penelope]
This is your only way home
The lair of Scylla

[Odysseus]
But Scylla has a cost

[Penelope]
Well, you asked and now you know
Now jump in the water!

[Odysseus]
Penelope, why?
You know I'm too shy and terrified

[Penelope]
I would take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
Oh, for you I would die, but can't you let me stay dry?

[Penelope]
I can take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
You should come onto the ship
We'll jump at the same time

[Penelope]
I will take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
Ah, the things I do for you

I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached

Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche

You ain't been up off that porch, now

Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that

Wish I could roll on back to that old town road

Sleep Token,Rain,"For so long, I have waited
So long that I almost became
Just a stoic statue, fit for nobody
And I don't wanna get in your way
But I finally think I can say
That the vicious cycle was over
The moment you smiled at me

And just like the rain
You cast the dust into nothing
And wash out the salt from my hands
So touch me again
I feel my shadow dissolving
Will you cleanse me with pleasure?

It's that chemical cut that I can get down with
Up like the Moon and out like the hounds
A dangerous disposition somehow refracted in light, reflected in sound
I'm coiled up like the venomous serpent, tangled in your trance and I'm certain
You have got your hooks in me

I know, I know, the way that it goes
You get what you give, you reap what you sow
And I can see you in my fate
I know, I know, I am what I am
The mouth of the wolf, the eyes of the lamb
So darling, will you saturate?

And just like the rain
You cast the dust into nothing
And wash out the salt from my hands
So touch me again
I feel my shadow dissolving
Will you cleanse me with pleasure?

Nobody can say for certain
If maybe it's all just a game
When I open my eyes to the future
I can hear you say my name

So rain down on me
Rain down on me
Rain down on me
Rain down on me
Rain down on me
Rain down on me
Rain down on me
Rain down on me
Rain down on me
Rain down on me
Rain down on me

"
John Newton,Amazing Grace,"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the Sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun

James Lord Pierpont,Jingle Bells,"Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way

Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon, Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side

The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way

Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride

Avenged Sevenfold,A Little Piece of Heaven,"Before the story begins
Is it such a sin
For me to take what's mine
Until the end of time?
We were more than friends
Before the story ends
And I will take what's mine
Create what God would never design

Our love had been so strong for far too long
I was weak with fear that something would go wrong
Before the possibilities came true
I took all possibility from you

Almost laughed myself to tears
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Conjuring her deepest fears
(Come here, you fucking bitch)

Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes
Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it

She was never this good in bed
Even when she was sleeping
Now, she's just so perfect
I've never been quite so fucking deep in

It goes on and on, and on
I can keep you looking young and preserved forever
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
Would be cold, that's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time
But bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over, but it's just begun
Baby, don't cry

You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
But, baby, don't cry

Now, possibilities I'd never considered
Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard
Now, an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
To repossess a body with which I'd misbehaved

Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears

Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it
(Eat the shit out of it)

Now that it's done
I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave

I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time
But bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over, but it's just begun
But, baby, don't cry

You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
But, baby, don't cry

I will (what will you do?) suffer for so long
(Not long enough)
To make it up to you
(I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do
(Well then I'll grant you one chance)
And if (if it's not enough) it's not enough
(If it's not enough)
If it's not enough
(Not enough)
Try again
(Try again)
And again
(And again)
Over and over again

We're coming back, coming back
We'll live forever, live forever
Let's have a wedding, have a wedding
Let's start the killing, start the killing

Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
(Yes, I do)
Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
(I do)
I now pronounce you

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
Would be cold, that's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time
But bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over, but it's just begun
But, baby, don't cry

You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
But, baby, don't cry

Jonathan Steingard,Wildfire,"Wrapped in biting wind
Hearts will never bleed
Frozen and banished
Out of grief
In their restless dreams
They try so hard to breathe
Pulses flutter and sting
Within this bleakness
(Ah, ah)

Pain will come with the blade
Pain will wake up the despondent crowd in this dormant world
Somehow
Unsheathe a sword not to kill
Unsheathe a sword to rend those clouds above the ground
Wake up, it's time to gather now

The only warmth remains
In hands clasped so tight
The only fire exists
In brave hearts
Seasons that refuse
To change over the years
Will find their way back
Back on track
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

We've made a choice, go fight against your fate!
Pain will come with the blade
Pain will wake up the despondent crowd in this dormant world
Somehow
Unsheathe a sword not to kill
Unsheathe a sword to rend those clouds above the ground
Wake up, it's time to gather now

Forget about the rules written on weathered rock
There were chasers of light
Find the way or get lost
We have no way to know where they all headed for
See the light from afar, just blaze through the thorns
We know it's right over there
We have something to declare
Whatever is arriving, we'll be prepared

We've made a choice, go fight against your fate!
Pain will come with the blade
Pain will wake up the despondent crowd in this dormant world somehow
Unsheathe a sword not to kill
Unsheathe a sword to rend those clouds above the ground
Wake up to hear the cheering sound

Bring Me The Horizon,DArkSide,"Sinking under
Think my angel's fallen
Safe place plundered
Bastards kicks the doors in

Picked the stitches, now I can't stop bleeding
Three in the morning, I ain't slept all weekend
Six feet in the dirt, still breathing
Don't give a fuck if my heart stops beating

Hey, I'm begging you to stay
My dark side won today
My heart keeps breaking
Over and over
Hey, don't let me out your sight
Can't trust myself tonight
My heart keeps breaking
Can you talk me off the ledge again?

Something haunts me
Footsteps in the basement
Out of body
But there's no escaping

Picked the stitches, now I can't stop bleeding
Three in the morning, I ain't slept all weekend
Six feet in the dirt, still breathing
Don't give a fuck if my heart stops beating

Hey, I'm begging you to stay
My dark side won today
My heart keeps breaking
Over and over
Hey, don't let me out your sight
Can't trust myself tonight
My heart keeps breaking
Can you talk me off the ledge again?

Something's in the way
Don't know what I can say
Memories are haunting me
A sickness taking over
So bury me alive
There's nowhere left to hide
And I say goodbye, 'cause maybe I
Maybe I won't miss me when I'm gone

Hey, I'm begging you to stay
My dark side won today
My heart keeps breaking
Over and over
Hey, don't let me out your sight
Can't trust myself tonight
My heart keeps breaking
Can you talk me off the ledge again?

Can't trust myself tonight
Can't trust myself tonight
Can't trust myself
Can you talk me off the ledge again?

Bring Me The Horizon,sugar honey ice & tea,"Count down the thunder
I think we're too close for comfort
So no, don't rock the boat and don't calm the storm
God already gave you his answer

Blink, I'm sorry it's over
The whistle's been blown
I think you got the wrong number
I'm breaking up
Wanna make a connection
Can't get no reception
Leave a message after the tone

'Cause it's got my head running 24/7
I don't know if I can figure it out
It's so messed up, only one thing I know for sure
We're so full of sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Everybody's full of sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea

Don't move a muscle
No, we can't have a struggle
But the situation is in control
So play pretend that it's all good

You could tell the Messiah
His pants are on fire
I'll politely decline
I, I gotta go, I gotta stick my head in the sand
And block out all the sadness
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

'Cause it's got my head running 24/7

Who the hell died and made you the king?
We don't know what we want, but we know that we want it
Yeah, we want it
Yeah, we want it right now

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

Sugar, honey, ice, and tea (oh, and now everybody full of)

Falling In Reverse,The Drug In Me Is You,"I heard a knock upon my door the other day
I opened it to find death staring in my face
The feel of mortal stalking still reverberates
Everywhere I go, I drag this coffin just in case

My body's trembling sends shivers down my spine
Adrenaline kicks in, shifts into overdrive
Your secrets keep you sick, your lies keep you alive
Snake eyes every single time you roll with crooked dice

I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down
The kind of dark that haunts a hundred-year-old house
I wrestle with my thoughts, I shook the hand of doubt
Running from my past, I'm praying: Feet, don't fail me now

I've lost my goddamn mind, it happens all the time
I can't believe I'm actually meant to be here
Trying to consume, the drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery, can't you see?

I got these questions always running through my head
So many things that I would like to understand
If we are born to die and we all die to live
Then what's the point of living life if it just contradicts?

I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down
The kind of dark that haunts a hundred-year-old house
I wrestle with my thoughts, I shook the hand of doubt
Running from my past, I'm praying: Feet, don't fail me now

I've lost my goddamn mind, it happens all the time
I can't believe I'm actually meant to be here
Trying to consume, the drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery, can't you see?

I've lost myself
You tried to reach me, but you just can't help me
So long, goodbye
You tried to save me, it won't work this time

'Cause now I've lost my fucking mind and there's no fucking time
I can't believe I'm actually meant to be here
Trying to consume, the drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery, can't you see?

Oh, can't you see?
Can't you see?

Sleeping With Sirens,How it feels to be lost,"Life is walking on a tight rope
With nothing but a blindfold

I'm, yeah, I'm a little crazy
But can you really blame me?

For every step that I take
I take two steps back

It's like a knife right in the

It's like a knife right in the back
Like a bullet to the head
Why can't I understand?
The blood is on my hands
Now I'm standing on the edge
With nowhere to go (to go)
This is how it feels, this is how it feels
How it feels to be
Lost, lost

I've been stranded in an ocean
Treading water but it's hopeless, hopeless
It's a long way, it's a long way down
Why am I always on the brink of
Losing it all? Am I just wasting my time?
It's a long way, it's a long way down

For every step that I take
I take two steps back

And it's a long way down (long way down)

Why do I put myself through hell?
And will I ever understand
The blood is on my hands?

It's like a knife right in the back
Like a bullet to the head
Why can't I understand

With nowhere to go (to go)

For Today,Break The Cycle,"What have we done? What have we become?
A broken mirror reflecting only darkness
Disrupted visions and closed off hearts
We've turned our face away from those we're sent to love

But now I hear your voice calling me back home
It isn't over yet
Bringing hope into our hopelessness
Turning hearts from stone to flesh

In a world headed for self destruction, the answer is here
Are we too blind to see it?

Self destruction has tainted our way of life
It's time to break the cycle
In the darkness of fear, there's a dawning light
It's time to break the cycle

We stumble around and fall to the ground, but are we too proud to reach out
To reach for a hand that can help us to stand, and keep us from falling facedown?

We're only helpless, because we're heartless

In a world
Headed for self-destruction
The answer is here
Are we too blind to see it?
In a world headed for self-destruction
The answer is here; are we too blind to see it?

There is hope in the blood!
(So) rise up, there's a new day dawning!
We'll see the darkness flee
Rise up, there's a new day dawning, in which the blind will see!
I see a light in the darkness, rising in the night!
I see a light in the darkness, in the sons of light!

Bring this broken system to it's knees!
Bring this broken system to it's knees!
Break the cycle! Break the cycle!
We're only helpless, because we're heartless.

Ariana Grande,Love me Harder,"Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I'll take the pleasure
Take it with the pain

And if in the moment I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you'll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder (love me harder)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Harder, harder, harder

I know your motives and you know mine
The ones that love me I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and
Take it with the pain

And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I'll make it feel like the first time

'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder (I'ma love you harder) (hey)
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder (love me, baby) (love me harder)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Harder, harder, harder (oh)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Harder, harder, harder (you gotta love me harder)

So what do I do if I can't figure it out? (Figure it out)
You got to try, try, try again, yeah (oh, whoa)

Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light

Keep my heart beating like a drum

The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again

On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again
And I can't wait to get on the road again

Insisting that the world be turnin' our way
And our way

Bastille,Things We Lost In The Fire,"Things we lost to the flames
Things we'll never see again
All that we've amassed
Sits before us, shattered into ash

These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire

We sat and made a list
Of all the things that we had
Down the backs of table tops
Ticket stubs and your diaries
I read them all one day
When loneliness came and you were away
Oh they told me nothing new
But I love to read the words you used

These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire

I was the match and you were the rock
Maybe we started this fire
We sat apart and watched
All we had burn on the pyre

(You said) we were born with nothing
And we sure as hell have nothing now
(You said) we were born with nothing
And we sure as hell have nothing now

These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire

Do you understand that we will never be the same again?
Do you understand that we will never be the same again?
The future's in our hands and we will never be the same again
The future's in our hands and we will never be the same again

These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire fire fire
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire fire fire
These are the things, the things we lost
The thing we lost in the fire fire fire

Flames, they licked the walls
Tenderly, they turned to dust all that I adore

So much as come before those battles lost and won
This life is shining more forever in the Sun
Now let us check our heads and let us check the surf
Staying high and dry's more trouble than it's worth in the Sun

Just a mirror for the Sun
Just a mirror for the Sun
These Smiling eyes are just a mirror for

In Big Sur we take some time to linger on
We three hunky dory's got our snakefinger on

Elvis Presley,Can't Help Falling In Love,"Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love with you

Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help

Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help
Falling in love with you

Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes

Take my hand
Take my whole life too

Tauren Wells,Joy In The Morning,"Everything happens for a reason
But you don't know what you don't know
And you'll never have peace if you don't let go of tomorrow

But you still choose to follow
If it doesn't make sense right now
It will when it's over

There will be joy in the morning
There will be joy in the morning

Giving in to your feelings
Is like drowning in the shadows
Oh you got to keep believing
Even in the middle of the unknown
'Cause grace will be there when you come to the end of your rope
And you let go
It may feel like you're going down now
But the story isn't over

There will be joy in the morning
There will be joy in the morning
If it's not good, then He's not done
No, He's not done with it yet
There will be joy in the morning

Beware, beware, be skeptical
Of their smiles, their smiles of plated gold
Deceit so natural
But a wolf in sheep's clothing is more than a warning

Baa-baa, black sheep, have you any soul?
No sir, by the way, what the hell are morals?
Jack, be nimble, Jack, be quick
Jill's a little whore and her alibis are turning tricks

Telling all your lies like second nature

Aware, aware, you stalk your prey
With criminal mentality
You sink your teeth into the people you depend on
Infecting everyone, you're quite the problem

Fee-fi-fo-fum, you better run and hide
I smell the blood of a petty little coward
Jack, be lethal, Jack, be slick
